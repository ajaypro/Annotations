# Annotations
small demo of usage of annoations in java and android 

## Explanation
 
 * metadata that gives information about other data 
 * They are just info about your code 
 * @Override - avoids typo of the method that is declared in the class or interface from where we are inheriting  
    will work even if we don't mention but 
 * @Target - To specify in where annotation to be placed, like on method, variable, class etc..., don't specify is present everywhere
 * @RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME - retains class in VM during runtime.
